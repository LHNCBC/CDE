#Introduction

In recent years, Common Data Elements (CDEs) have been deve
loped to unify data collection in clinical studies. Since 2015, a CDE repository maintained by the National Library of Medicine allows retrieval of CDEs across several initiatives. With wider availability of de-identified patient-level clinical trialsâ€™ data across research studies, organizing data elements using a hierarchical system can improve ability of researchers to discover relevant data to re-use.
