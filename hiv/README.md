# HIV/AIDS focused research in Common Data Elements (CDEs)

Title: Identification of Research Common Data Elements in HIV/AIDS using data science methods

## Aims
- AIM 1: Evaluate existing efforts that share de-identified patient-level HIV/AIDS human clinical studies (interventional trials or observational studies)
- AIM 2: Analyze data for a cohort of HIV/AIDS patients in Electronic Health Record databases
- AIM 3: Design clinical research informatics solutions that provide optimal syntactic format and semantic terminology bindings for sharing HIV/AIDS trial data


## What are research Common Data Elements?

Several initiatives now exist that try to harmonize data collection in human clinical trials. If a Data Element (DE) is used in at least 2 studies, it can be considered a Common DE. 

## Benefits of the project

- learn from a large collection of HIV/AIDS studies
- provide recommendations for future HIV/AIDS studies
- improve existing HIV/AIDS CDE efforts
- inform other domains of research (non HIV/AIDS) on best practices for sharing de-identified Individual Participant Data (IPD) and CDE efforts in other domains
