# Study investigator 

## Set of recommendations:
-	Provide data dictionary documentation separate from de-identified individual participant data. Since it contains no participant level data, do not require local ethical approval as a condition of releasing the data dictionary (no request-wall).
-	Utilize ClinicalTrials.gov fields for uploading study protocol, empty case report forms, statistical analysis plan and link to 
    -	Example trial: https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00923936
-	Provide basic summary results using results registry component of Clinicaltrials.gov
-	Share Case Report Forms in non-PDF, machine readable format. For example, REDCap, OpenClinica and several other Electronic Data Capture (EDC) systems allow export into CDISC Operational Data Model (ODM) format for forms. If no cross-platform standard is supported by your EDC, provide CRFs in the platform-specific format. 
-	If you considered formally defined research Common Data Elements at study design (more common for studies initiated after 2015), provide a spreadsheet file that lists all CDEs utilized by your study. Include unique CDE identifies (e.g., PhenX VariableID).  
-	Use data formats that can be natively loaded (without add-ons) into multiple statistical platforms (e.g., prefer comma/tab separated values (.CSV) files to SAS XPT, XLS/XSLX) 

 
-	Distinguish string field with free text from string field (with a set of permissible values)
-	For pick list questions, provide in data dictionary the options that are possible
